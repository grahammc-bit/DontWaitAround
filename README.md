# DontWaitAround
Don't feel like staying the full duration of zoom class for attendance? This chrome extension will fix that! Just set the timer and walk away and the tab will close after the allotted period has passed.

To install, navigate to chrome://extensions in your Google Chrome URL bar and then select "Load unpacked". Navigate to the Don't Wait Around folder and select it. The extension will then be installed as normal.
